                        As the first project of Polytechnique's Software Engineering program, we had to build a hardware
                        and software system. This system was based on a virtual microcontroller, due to the COVID-19
                        pandemic.<br>
                        We had to write a library in C++ in order to add various functionalities to our robot (including
                        inputs/outputs and peripherals). For example, the robot had to move forward for a certain number
                        of seconds and then stop. We also had to manipulate the LED lights' colors.<br>
                        Of course, we had to learn about Makefiles in order to compile our code (reminder: C++ is a
                        compiled language) and what we wrote had to be understandable and coherent.<br>
                        During this project, communication was the key to success, that is why we had to explain to each
                        other the lines of code we added before pushing the modifications on Git.<br>
                        In short, this project taught us how to behave during a teamwork, we learned a lot about C++ and
                        its use in such a hardware.<br>

                        As the first game we ever had to program we had to learn about GUI and MVC architectural pattern 
                        to understand how to make us interact with the game. While coding the game we had to use physics 
                        formula and apply some math to make the game entertaining.

                        The goal of this project was to create my own Resume Website and my own Photography Website.
                        I wanted to learn these languages by creating something that could potentially be useful for
                        me.<br>
                        I first started by learning the basics of HTML, then I wanted to learn CSS in order to style my
                        websites.
                        Thereafter, I wanted to add some features (such as switching between light/night mode and be able
                        to choose type of pictures), so I
                        had to learn Javascript.<br>
                        From time to time, I still try to improve my Web Resume.<br>

                        To be able to understand C++ better I force myself to try to code something that I love doing (sudoku)
                        and it really help me get a better grasped on how to use C++.<br>
